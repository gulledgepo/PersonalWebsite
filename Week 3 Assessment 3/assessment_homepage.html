				 <p>From former Division Officer on the USS Essex, LT Miller</p>
				 <blockquote cite="LT Miller"> A true pleasure to work with. Paxston was in charge of a team of 8 personnel in refurbishing of the decking and flooring aboard the USS Essex during its
				 extended maintenance period. He could always be counted upon to produce the highest quality of work with no immediate supervision required. All of his subordinates sang
				 praises when it came to how he led them.
				 </blockquote> 
				 <p>From former colleague aboard the USS Essex, Ricardo Gonzalez</p>
				 <blockquote> He was truly one of the most knowledgable co-workers and friends I have ever had. He made it his business to know everything there was to know about the
				 equipment he worked on. He was often sought after whenever a problem arose, because people knew he would give it his all to make sure it was fixed.
