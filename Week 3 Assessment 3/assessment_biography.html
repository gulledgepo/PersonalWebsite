				 <p>My name is Paxston Gulledge. I have always been fascinated by computers. While becoming enamored with video games at a young age, this translated into a desire to create 
				 over time. I first began creating while making custom games for a game called Warcraft 3. I joined the Navy in 2009 and spent six years in active duty. I worked on the 
				 primary firecontrol radar, the Mk-23 Target Acquisition System, during my time in the Navy. During the Navy, I rekindled with an old friend who would eventually 
				 become my wife. Allison, my wife, and I have been married for three years. I am currently enrolled in California College San Diego where I am majoring in 
				 computer science with an emphasis on software development.
