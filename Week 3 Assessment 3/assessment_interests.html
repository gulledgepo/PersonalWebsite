				 <p>I am an avid video game player. My favorite video game is DotA 2. It is an online competitive game that pits five players against five other players. When I am not 
				 playing video games, I am enjoying life with my wife. We are both quite into fitness and work out several times a week. When we are not working out or playing video 
				 games, we are usually watching television or movies together. We both have a great love for good cinema.
